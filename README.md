# Small Scripts for ArmA 3 from KP

### KP Fuel Consumption Script
**File:** `kp_fuel_consumption.sqf`

This script handles the fuel consumption of vehicles, so that refueling will be necessary more often. It also checks if the vehicle is standing with running engine, driving in normal speed or max speed. With this script you'll have the need to refuel the vehicle during an evening session with a suitable setup by default (full configurable). So no more "never ending" fuel available due to the normal ArmA 3 fuel consumption mechanic.

### KP Random Wreckspawn Script
**File:** `kp_wreckspawn.sqf`

Place random wrecks on the roads of the map. You don't need to place anything in the editor or something. This script will place in a free configurable mininum and maximum distance random wrecks on the roads. Also with a adjustable chance to spawn more wrecks in the direct vicinity of the last spawned wreck, so it'll also create random roadblocks.
